## Installation

Run this command in a UNIX shell.

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/monsendag/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc
```

## What does the dotfiles command do?

1. Git is installed if necessary, via APT or Homebrew (which is installed if necessary).
2. This repo is cloned into the `~/.dotfiles` directory (or updated if it already exists).
2. Files in `init` are executed (in alphanumeric order).
3. Files in `copy` are copied into `~/`.
4. Files in `link` are linked into `~/`.

Note:

* The `backups` folder only gets created when necessary. Any files in `~/` that would have been overwritten by `copy` or `link` get backed up there.
* Files in `bin` are executable shell scripts. The folder is prepended to PATH).
* Files in `zshrc` gets sourced when starting a new zsh shell.
* Files in `bash` get sourced when starting a new bash shell.
* Files in `conf` just sit there. If a config file doesn't _need_ to go in `~/`, put it in there.
* Files in `caches` are cached files, only used by some scripts. This folder will only be created if necessary.

## The "init" step
These things will be installed, but _only_ if they aren't already.

### OS X
* Homebrew
  * git
  * tree
  * sl
  * lesspipe

### Ubuntu
* APT
  * git-core
  * build-essential
  * libssl-dev
  * tree
  * sl

## The ~/ "copy" step
Any file in the `copy` subdirectory will be copied into `~/`. Any file that _needs_ to be modified with personal information (like [.gitconfig](https://github.com/monsendag/dotfiles/blob/master/copy/.gitconfig) which contains an email address and private key) should be _copied_ into `~/`. Because the file you'll be editing is no longer in `~/.dotfiles`, it's less likely to be accidentally committed into your public dotfiles repo.

## The ~/ "link" step
Any file in the `link` subdirectory gets symbolically linked with `ln -s` into `~/`. Edit these, and you change the file in the repo. Don't link files containing sensitive data, or you might accidentally commit that data!
